This project aims to use blockchain technology to track data from gourmet cocoa production. This is a collaboration for the project IoT-Cocoa (read the article [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8937903/)).

## Project stage

The project is in the **Development** stage.

## Branches

This project started at UFBA master's degree course, with the subject **Distributed Systems Topics**. So I created two branches. One for the final project (master branch), and another one for the subject milestones (milestones branch).

- **[Master branch](https://github.com/Levysantiago/blockchain_data_tracking_system/tree/master)**: The final project;
- **[Milestones branch](https://github.com/Levysantiago/blockchain_data_tracking_system/tree/milestones)**: The milestones for the master's degree subject.
